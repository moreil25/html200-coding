/*For this assignment, you don't need to build a web page that contains a calculator where the user can press buttons and such. Instead, you just have to make a Javascript program that can be called from the Javascript console and used to perform basic calculator functions, like add/subtract/multiply/divide. Of course, Javascript itself should be able to perform the heavy lifting of the math calculations, so you just have to call the built-in functions accordingly. Does that make sense?*/

/*This Regular Challenge homework is required.
Fork and clone the class repository for assignments: https://github.com/UWFront-End-Cert/html200-coding
Follow good file organization and naming conventions. For each lesson, create a directory appropriately labeled for that lesson. E.g. for this week, create a  Lesson02 directory in your local repository.
Write a program called calculator.js. We've demonstrated writing code using CodePen. Feel free to use this tool or another that you are comfortable with.
Declare at least 4 variables, and then do math operations on them. Mix and match operators and variables and console log the results of these operations.
Save your work to the Lesson02 directory.
Make a pull request to the parent directory.*/
