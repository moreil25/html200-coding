/*This Regular Challenge homework is required.

Fork and clone the class repository for assignments: https://github.com/UWFront-End-Cert/html200-coding

Follow good file organization and naming conventions. For each lesson, create a directory appropriately labeled for that lesson. E.g. for this week, create a  Lesson02 directory in your local repository.

Write a program called calculator.js. We've demonstrated writing code using CodePen. Feel free to use this tool or another that you are comfortable with.

Declare at least 4 variables, and then do math operations on them. Mix and match operators and variables and console log the results of these operations.

Save your work to the Lesson02 directory.

Make a pull request to the parent directory.*/
